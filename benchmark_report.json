To get started, can I have your full name? Why do you need that? Good question. I just need it to create your quote and make sure your info is saved if we need to connect you with a license station. All right. My name is Marcus Hill. Perfect. Thanks. Based on your location, we've got a few good options. Would you like to talk to a customer care agent now to go over the details? Perfect. Thanks, Rachel. Could I also get your zip code or address? That helps us check which plans are available in your area. ZIP is 9407. I'm in San Francisco. Yeah, sure.",

No, not really. I've done this before and ended up getting a bunch of spam calls. Totally hear you and I appreciate you being honest. Just to clarify, we only use your info to help our licensed agent guide you through cover options. No spam, no pressure, AI, plus. Sometimes there are local discounts or bundled savings they can walk you through. It usually just takes a few minutes. Hmm. I don't know. No worries if you're not ready. But it could save you a good amount, especially in your zip. Want to just hear what they say? All right, fine. I'll talk to them, but just for a quick quote, totally fair.
